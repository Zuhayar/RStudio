# Problem 0:
setwd("~/Downloads") 
HR = read.table("HR_Data.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)
```

# Problem 1
```{r}
# (a)
HRcount <- table(HR$dept)
max(HRcount)
min(HRcount)
#sales is largest with 4140
#management is smallest with 630

# (b)

## Test:chi squared test for uniform expected counts
## Null Hypothesis: That the counts are equal in proportion
## Alt Hypothesis: That the counts aren't equal in proportion
chisq.test(HRcount)
# (c)
# pval = 2.2e-16
# Conclusion: the P value is statistically significant therefore we can assume that we have enough evidence to deny the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis 

# (d)
# Assumption: test doesn't have any assumptions for normality as it is not a t-test 
```

# Problem 2
```{r}
# (a)
HRdept_status <- table(HR$dept,HR$left)
# (b)
HRdept_status/nrow(HR)
#Lowest rate of leaving were in management 
#highest rate of leaving was seen in sales
# (c)
chisq.test(HRdept_status)
#Test:chi squared test for independence
## Null Hypothesis: department and leaving are independent
## Alt Hypothesis: department and leaving aren't independent

#pval = 7.042e-15
# Conclusion: the P value is statistically significant therefore we can assume that the department you work in and leaving aren't independent 

```

# Problem 3
```{r}
# (a)
HR_accident_left <- table(HR$left,HR$Work_accident)
# (b)
WORK_accident= HR[HR$Work_accident == 1,]

## Test:bninomial test 
## Null Hypothesis: Of the employees who had an accident 5% of them left the company 
## Alt Hypothesis: Of the employees who had an accident more than 5% of them left the company 
binom.test(169,nrow(WORK_accident),p = .05,alternative = "greater", conf.level = .95)
# (c)
# pval = 1.837e-08
# Conclusion: The p value is statistically signifant and we can deny the null hypothesis and accept the alternative therefore the rate of employees who had an accident leaving the company is greater than 5%
```

# Problem 4
```{r}
# (a)
## Test: 2 sample t test
##
## Null Hypothesis: satisfaction level among employees who did/didn't have an accident are the same
## Alt Hypothesis: satisfaction level among employees among employees who had an accident is less than the satisfaction level of employess who didn't have an accident 

# (b)
t.test(HR$satisfaction_level~HR$Work_accident,alternative = "less",conf.level = .95)
# p-value = 1.518e-14
# Conclusion: p value is statistica
# (c)
#Assumptions: independent and normality and random sample 
qqnorm(HR$satisfaction_level)
#independence is satisfied 
```

# Problem 5
```{r}
# (a)
## Hypo Test: 2 sample t - test 
## Assumptions:  independent and normality and random sample 
## Null Hypothesis: Average monthly workers worked by employees who left is the same than ones who stayed 
## Alt Hypothesis: Average monthly workers worked by employees who left is greater than ones who stayed 

# (b)
t.test(HR$average_montly_hours ~ HR$left , alternative = "less", conf.level = .95)
# p-value = 2.954e-14
# Conclusion: Deny the null and accept the average amount of hours worked by people who left is higher than people who stayed 

# (c)
qqnorm(HR$average_montly_hours)
# independence is satisfied 

```
# Problem 6
```{r}
HR_Stay =HR[HR$left ==0,]
HR_Left=HR[HR$left==1,]

plot(HR_Stay$satisfaction_level~HR_Stay$average_montly_hours,xlab = "average monthly hours",ylab = "satisfaction level",ylim = c(0,1),xlim = c(100,300),col = "red")
par(new = T)
plot(HR_Left$satisfaction_level~HR_Left$average_montly_hours,xlab = "average monthly hours",ylab = "satisfaction level",ylim = c(0,1),xlim = c(100,300),col = "blue")

#Blue is workers who left and there is a clear correlation between workers leaving and them having a poor satisfaction rate. Furthermore, workers who left also worked significantly more hours than ones who stayed.
