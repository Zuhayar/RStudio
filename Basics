# Problem 1
```{r}
# (a)
sqrt( 7/ (22 *pi) )

# (b)

exp(3 + log(3,7))

# (c)

factorial(10) / (factorial(5)^2)

```

# Problem 2
```{r}
# (a)

vec.a <- c(4,6,8,3,5,7)
vec.b <- c(0,1,0,2,0,3)


# (b)
vec.a + vec.b
# adds the vectors by lining the first number of both vectors then adding them together and then also for the second and so on until all numbers have been added 

#(c)

vec.a + 1
#adds 1 to each value in vec.a

#(d)
vec.a[1:3] + vec.b[4:6]
#adds first 3 elements of vec.a to vec.b 

#(e)
vec.aa <- rep(vec.a,2)
#creates a second vector that repeats vec.a twice and store it in a new vector called vec.aa

#(f)
vec.aa + vec.a 

# the vector vec.a is run through vec.aa and since it's too short it juat recycles the vector through vec.aa because vec.a is shorter than vec.aa

#(g)

vec.c <- c(11,13,15,17)
vec.a + vec.c 

#since vec.c isn't a multiple of vec.a it won't run through and you can't add them together. This is different from vec.a and vec.aa as vec.a is a multiple of vec.aa so it can add itself and recycle the values 

```


# Problem 3
```{r}
# (a)
data = rnorm(5,0,1)
# (b)
mean_data = mean(data)
sd_data = sd(data)
min_data = min(data)
max_data = max(data)
# (c)
sum_data = sum(data)
# (d)
positive.data <-data >= 0
```
Comment for (d):

goes through all data in the vector and returns true if positive and false if not
```{r}
# (e)
data[positive.data]
```
Comment for (e):

it returns all of the values that are positive in the vector

```{r}
# (f)
mean(positive.data)
sd(positive.data)
```
Comment for (f):

returns the meann and standard deviation of all of the positive values

```{r}
# (g)
negative.data <-data <=0
data[negative.data]
```
